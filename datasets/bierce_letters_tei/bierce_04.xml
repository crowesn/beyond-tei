            <p>Dec. 11, 1895.</p>
            <p>My dear <name type="person">Mr. Walsh</name></p>
            <p>Both your letters are received. <name type="person">I</name>’m right glad to know that <name type="person">you</name> went into your old place without
                friction because the other man didn’t fit the hole.</p>
            <p>Thank <name type="person">you</name> for what <name type="person">you</name> send <name type="person">me</name> about <name type="person">Lily</name>. <name type="person">I</name> had a copy of the little paper published at the
                <name type="org">Berkeley Institute</name>, which <name type="person">I</name> meant to send <name type="person">you</name>, but have lost it. It contained an appreciative
                article on <name type="person">Lily</name> and <name type="person">her</name> loss.</p>
            <p>On Monday last <name type="person">I</name> went to <name type="place">Oakland</name> and visited <name type="person">her</name> grave with a view to improving it, as we
                talked of. There has been so little rain, though, that the mound is not settled enough. After a few
                weeks of rainy weather <name type="person">I</name> shall have the little plot sown with grass and later enclosed and marked.
                <name type="person">I</name> wish <name type="person">I</name> were permitted to put <name type="person">her</name> wittily pathetic epitaph on <name type="person">her</name> headstone. <name type="person">I</name> would do it, sure.
                <name type="person">I</name> hear from <name type="perseon">Dr. Doyle</name> every few days. <name type="person">He</name> frequently mentions <name type="person">you</name> in a kindly way. <name type="person">Miss Hogan</name> <name type="person">I</name> have not seen since <name type="person">you</name> were here. <name type="person">She</name> is to marry soon, <name type="person">I</name> believe.</p>
            <p><name type="person">I</name> hope time is doing something for <name type="person">you</name> in your double bereavement—<name type="person">I</name> have not yet become reconciled to my single one.</p>
            <p>Sincerely yours,</p>
            <p><name type="person">Ambrose Bierce.</name></p>
