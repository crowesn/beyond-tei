            <p>Friday morn’g.</p>
            <p>Dear <name type="person">Lily</name></p>
            <p>It is pleasant to learn that <name type="person">you</name> are feeling so much better. <name type="person">I</name> should like to go to <name type="person">you</name>, but last
                evening own illness took a sudden bad turn, and today <name type="person">I</name>’m unable (after a night of suffering)
                to rise from my chair. <name type="person">I</name> shall have to go back to <name type="place">Los Gatos</name> the moment <name type="person">I</name> can be moved. <name type="person">I</name>’ve
                been here now for more than two weeks, and growing worse all the time. No day have <name type="person">I</name> felt well
                enough even to cross the bay to <name type="place">San Francisco</name>, where <name type="person">I</name> have urgent business.</p>
            <p>Before <name type="person">I</name> go your <name type="person">brother</name> will be with <name type="person">you</name>—<name type="person">I</name> have not felt like leaving <name type="person">you</name> entirely alone among
                strangers, for although <name type="person">I</name> could do nothing for <name type="person">you</name>, it seemed as if it must be pleasant for <name type="person">you</name> to
                know that <name type="person">I</name> was near by in case anything should happen to <name type="person">you</name>—<name type="person">I</name> mean if <name type="person">you</name> should get worse.
                But now <name type="person">you</name> will be all right. Of course <name type="person">I</name> should like to see your <name type="person">brother</name> if <name type="person">he</name> will call. Maybe <name type="person">I</name>
                shall not be able to talk much to <name type="person">him</name>, but if <name type="person">he</name> does not mind that please ask <name type="person">him</name> to call. <name type="person">I</name> shall
                try to see <name type="person">you</name> again before going away.</p>
            <p><name type="person">You</name> must not hesitate to let <name type="person">me</name> know, dear child, when <name type="person">I</name> can serve <name type="person">you</name> in any way, no matter
                where <name type="person">I</name> am. And please let me hear from <name type="person">you</name>—how <name type="person">you</name> are and all about <name type="person">you</name>. Address <name type="person">me</name> as
                usual—“Box 73.”</p>
            <p>Be brave—“with a heart for any fate.” And if the need of all your courage should come,
                remember that <name type="person">I</name> confidently count upon your having it. Whatever may seem, remember that
                God, Nature—whatever it is that orders things, if things are ordered at all—is not going to be
                hard upon poor little harmless <name type="person">you</name>.</p>
            <p><name type="person">A.B.</name></p>
