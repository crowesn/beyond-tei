            <p>Sept. 2, 1896.</p>
            <p>My dear <name type="person">Walsh</name></p>
            <p><name type="person">I</name> have had some copies made of <name type="person">Lily</name>’s faded photograph, and will divide them with <name type="person">you</name>. They
                are rather better than the original picture, being darker and more distinct. Can <name type="person">you</name> tell me at
                about what age the picture was taken?</p>
            <p>My health has been so bad here that <name type="person">I</name> am going to the <name type="place">city</name> about the first of next week. If no
                better there <name type="person">I</name> shall go back to God’s country—which is a more comfortable place to be miserable
                in. My chief regard in leaving <name type="place">Jersey</name> is that <name type="person">I</name> have not seen that “city of the soul,” Greater
                <name type="place">Mahwah</name>. Possibly <name type="person">you</name> recall the admirable poem about the old French peasant, the dream of
                whose life had been to visit <name type="place">Carcassonne</name>, visible in the distances, and who died in that unfulfilled
                hope.</p>
            <p>Sincerely yours,</p>
            <p><name type="person">Ambrose Bierce.</name></p>
