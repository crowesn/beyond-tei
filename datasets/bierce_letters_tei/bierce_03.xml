            <p>Friday evening.</p>
            <p>Dear <name type="person">Mr. Walsh</name></p>
            <p><name type="person">You</name> are being hit pretty hard, truly, and <name type="person">I</name>’m right sorry for <name type="person">you</name>. But there’s nothing to be said—
                we must “take our medicine” in any shape that pleases the Physician of Souls. <name type="person">I</name> only wish it
                were possible to think it good for us always. As to the suicide phase of it, <name type="person">I</name>’d not let that bother
                <name type="person">me</name> if <name type="person">I</name> were <name type="person">you</name>. The <name type="person">lad</name> had an indisputable right to quit the game of life whenever <name type="person">he</name> pleased:
                all the sophistries of all the priesthoods cannot cloud one’s life to one’s heritage of sleep
                whenever one chooses to claim it. If we were religious—not church-religious—it might be
                permitted us to hope that matters were so ordered that <name type="person">Lily</name>might have some stronger soul to
                welcome <name type="person">her</name> on the other side.</p>
            <p>What <name type="person">you</name> tell me of <name type="person">Lily</name>'s wish to be buried near <name type="person">me</name> is—well, <name type="person">I</name> am rather sorry to know about it
                now. If <name type="person">you</name> had told me when <name type="person">I</name> saw you <name type="person">I</name> should certainly have begged <name type="person">you</name> to permit <name type="person">me</name> to
                have the wish carried into effect. It is not for <name type="person">me</name> to inquire into your reasons for not granting
                it—<name type="person">I</name> can only say that <name type="person">I</name> am sorry there were any circumstances that prevented.</p>
            <p><name type="person">I</name> shall be glad to see <name type="person">you</name> on Monday. Please give my regards to your <name type="person">uncle</name> and <name type="person">aunt</name>, and
                believe me most sincerely yours,</p>
            <p><name type="person">Ambrose Bierce.</name></p>
