            <p>Feb’y 16, 1896.</p>
            <p>My dear <name type="person">Mr. Walsh</name></p>
            <p><name type="person">I</name> have been trying ever since my arrival here to find time to reply even briefly to <name type="person">your</name> letter of a
                month ago. <name type="person">I</name> am living in a whirl of “moil and turmoil,” and hardly get time hardly to eat and
                sleep. So all my correspondents are neglected. <name type="person">I</name> came <name type="place">here</name> (with my <name type="person">boy</name>) three weeks ago, and
                since then have been in <name type="place">New York</name> three times; so <name type="person">you</name> can see that <name type="person">I</name>’m “on the jump” a little.
                Even when there <name type="person">I</name> saw none of my friends, and had not time to look <name type="person">you</name> up—though <name type="person">I</name> don’t
                know if <name type="person">you</name> are to be found there.</p>
            <p>Did <name type="person">I</name> tell <name type="person">you</name>? <name type="person">I</name>m looking over some of <name type="person">Lily</name>’s papers. <name type="person">I</name> found a photograph of <name type="person">her</name>—a fairly
                good one, apparently taken 3 or 4 years ago. So do not bother to look up one for <name type="person">me</name>.</p>
            <p><name type="person">I</name> saw <name type="person">Miss Hogan</name> but once since <name type="person">Lily</name>’s death, and that was before getting <name type="person">your</name> letter; so <name type="person">I</name> cannot
                say about the pillow.</p>
            <p>Since coming here <name type="person">I</name> have written <name type="person">Mrs. Hirshberg</name> instructions about beautifying <name type="person">Lily</name>’s grave; <name type="person">she</name>
                kindly undertook to do so. Before <name type="person">I</name> left not enough rain had fallen to settle the little mound and
                make it possible to get the grass going. It will be all green now, and when I go back I shall give
                it a border and a stone; or if <name type="person">I</name> do not go back soon <name type="person">Mrs. Hirshberg</name> will attend to it for <name type="person">me</name>. My
                movements are uncertain; <name type="person">I</name> am on a special mission here for <name type="org">The Examiner</name> but it may expire
                any day, and then it is likely <name type="person">I</name> shall go to <name type="place">New York</name> for <name type="org">The Journal</name>, for a while. <name type="person">I</name> was
                summoned up there by telegraph a week ago to-day to write one editorial.</p>
            <p><name type="person">Your</name> village experiences with the sages of the parish must amuse <name type="person">you</name>. As yet <name type="person">I</name> have been
                unable to find <name type="place">Rahway Mahwah</name> on any map. Has it been discovered by anybody but <name type="person">you</name>?</p>
            <p>My boy <name type="person">Leigh</name> is in <name type="place">N.Y.</name> working in the art department of <name type="org">The Journal</name>. <name type="person">I</name> suppose <name type="person">he</name> would
                care to see <name type="person">you</name>.</p>
            <p>Sincerely yours, <name type="person">Ambrose Bierce.</name></p>
