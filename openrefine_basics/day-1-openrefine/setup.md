> #### About the data
> The data for this lesson is a part of a historical records dataset from the Cincinnati House of Refuge Project. From 1850 to 1912, thousands of poor and "criminal" children were sent to the Cincinnati House of Refuge for care and rehabilitation. The project can be found here: [http://cincyrefuge.herokuapp.com/](http://cincyrefuge.herokuapp.com/)

For this lesson you will need **OpenRefine** (formerly Google Refine) and a
web browser.

Note: this is a Java program that runs on your machine (not in the cloud). It runs inside your browser, but no web connection is needed.

default browser. OpenRefine runs in your default browser. It will not run correctly in Internet Explorer.
- Download software from [http://openrefine.org](http://openrefine.org)
- Unzip the downloaded file into a directory by right-clicking and 
selecting “Extract…”. Name that directory something like OpenRefine.
- Go to your newly created OpenRefine directory.
- Launch OpenRefine
- Click the google-refine.exe (this will launch a command prompt window, but you can ignore that and wait for the browser to launch)
- If you are using a different browser, or OpenRefine does not automatically open for you, point your browser at http://127.0.0.1:3333/ or http://localhost:3333 to launch the program.
